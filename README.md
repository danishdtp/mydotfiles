# My Dotfiles configuration for debian linux\

#   1. Sway windows manager
I use sway window manager which is a light weight tiling window manager, this manager is managed with a single configuration file located in sway/config. I have customised it pretty much and added many features
#   2. fish shell
Insted of inbuil bash shell, I use fish shell, because it's highly intelligent and autocompletion is really intuitive. I can't live without it now.
#   3. foot terminal
I use this terminal because it is incredibly fast, starts instantly on a potato hardware and again this is also configured with single configuration file foot/foot.ini. I customised it to automatically login to my python environment and to open the shell in specified folder on startup.
#   4. neovim code editor
I use neovim with lazyvim starter pack. This is a powerhouse of code editor, run incredibly fast and has tons of feature. The configuration is in the nvim/lua/config and plugin folders. The scripts are in lua and lazy nvim handles most of the configurations automatically so you can focus on your work more.
